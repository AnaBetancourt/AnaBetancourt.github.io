As I sit here writing this it's hitting me that I am done. I did it! Wow. I know bootcamps are supposed to be shorter but this really has flown so fast! For the final project, my cohort and I were tasked with creating a project that incorporated everything we've learned through the program. To say it was a lot would be an understatement. I am so proud of all that I've accomplished and so excited to see where I will go from here in my career as a Software Engineer. 

  

### The Project 

The application I decided to create this time around was inspired by the team that maintains the React framework - Facebook. Initially I shot for a full-on social media-like site, however that proved to be a bit more than I could handle in time for the deadline. No problems there, I scaled things down a bit and still was social-media inspired but on a smaller scale. My application allows those who visit the site to browse meet-up events as well as post their own. It also enables parents to be able to create their own events and create posts on a forum-like section. The posts each have their own comment section to allow for discourse.  

  

### The Future 

As for my initial idea, I have not abandoned it! I have visions of a social media site dedicated to connecting parents and families. As a mother myself, I personally know how challenging parenting can be and how great it is to have others who know the struggle and have some tips! The future will definitely see my project come to life as I add in more features and functionality. I am excited for the challenges that lie ahead but feeling overall prepared. 

  

### The End 

So, this is it. The end of my Flatiron journey, but the beginning of my career journey! I now have the tools to find a career in the tech world not only with my current knowledge but with the knowledge of how to learn. I also find myself lucky to have met such great people in my cohort during this journey that I know will be assets in the future of my software engineering adventures.
